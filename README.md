# Ping_chilling

Reimplementation of the command ping in C.

Ping_chilling sends `ICMP_ECHO / ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST` to network hosts. It is used to check if a host is alive. It is also used to measure the round-trip time (RTT) between a host and the source.<br>
Ping_chilling is fully compatible with **IPV4** and **IPV6** adresses and handles DNS resolution.

# Usage

Do `make` and then run :

```bash
sudo ./ft_ping [options] <destination>
```

![make](files/make.png)

> You are requiered to run the program with sudo because the program uses raw sockets (`SOCK_RAW` with the socket function).
> We are aware that options such as `SOCK_DGRAM` exits but they don't seem to work with the function specified by the subject.

Or you can also use `make run` to run the program with the specified otions in the makefile.

The following options are handled by the program:

```bash
  -a                 use audible ping
  -c <count>         stop after <count> replies
  -D                 print timestamps
  -h                 print help and exit
  -i <interval>      seconds between sending each packet
  -q                 quiet output
  -t <ttl>           define time to live
  -v                 verbose output
  -V                 debug and verbose output
  -4                 use IPv4
  -6                 use IPv6
```

If you want to see what packets we send and what packets we receive, you can use the `-V` option:

![makedebug](files/makedebug.png)

> As you may notice we do not send a `iphdr / ip6_hdr` structure since it is generated by the sendto function. Futhermore we can modify the TTL value of said structure using the `IP_TTL / IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS` socket option with the setsockopt function.


We also have a `basic` branch that you can look at if you want to understand how a basic ping packet is sent and received. It supports **IPv4** and **IPv6**. However it lacks a lot of features and is only made for **educational purposes**.

# Checksum

A Checksum is a digit representing the sum of the bits in a piece of stored or transmitted digital data, against which later comparisons can be made to detect errors in the data.




![checksum](files/checksum.png)

> You can find many implementations of a checksum function in the [RFC1017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1071#section-4.1).<br>
> You do NOT need to calculate the checksum for the IPv6.<br>
> To calculate our checksum, we need to add the 16-bit of the packet together and reverse the result. We decided to make our own simple implementation of the checksum function, that you can find below:
```c
unsigned short checksum(unsigned short *address, size_t len)
{
	unsigned short sum = 0;
	while (len -= sizeof(short))
		sum += *address++;
	return (~sum);
}
```
